# Human Activity Recognition
 Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with Samsung Mobile Sensor Data and Fast v2

 
## Dataset

[1] Records 30 volunteer subjects, ages 19-48 years, performed six activities with mobile embedded accelerometer and gyroscope around the waist. captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Classes:

0: Walking
1: Walking Upstairs

3: Sitting
4: Standing
5: Laying
